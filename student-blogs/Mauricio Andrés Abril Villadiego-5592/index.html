                    <h3>Formula One</h3>
                    <p>
                        Formula One is the highest class of international racing for open-wheel single-seater formula
                        racing cars sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). The FIA Formula
                        One World Championship has been one of the premier forms of racing around the world since its
                        inaugural season in 1950. The word formula in the name refers to the set of rules to which all
                        participants' cars must conform. A Formula One season consists of a series of races, known as
                        Grands Prix. Grands Prix take place in multiple countries and continents around the world on
                        either purpose-built circuits or closed public roads. <br><br>


                        Formula One cars are the fastest regulated road-course racing cars in the world, owing to very
                        high cornering speeds achieved through the generation of large amounts of aerodynamic downforce.
                        Much of this downforce is generated by front and rear wings, which have the side effect of
                        causing severe turbulence behind each car. The turbulence reduces the downforce generated by the
                        cars following directly behind, making it hard to overtake. Major changes made to the cars for
                        the 2022 season has seen greater use of ground effect aerodynamics and modified wings to reduce
                        the turbulence behind the cars, with the goal of making overtaking easier.
